# BITE-PIPER Governance & Policy Documentation

## Project Overview

**BITE-PIPER** (Bite-Piper: Civic Decision-making AI) is a transparent, explainable AI system that leverages MeTTa (Meta Type Talk) and OpenCog Hyperon for socio-economic data analysis and funding allocation decisions in supply chain systems.

---

## Core Mission

Bite-Piper analyzes data across **socio-economic, policy rules, and feedback dimensions** to generate well-founded recommendations and clear explanations for each decision, promoting:

- **Transparency**: Every decision is traceable and explainable
- **Accountability**: All funding allocations have clear reasoning
- **Fairness**: Eliminating bias through data-driven analysis
- **Efficiency**: Reducing human error and accelerating analysis

---

## Problem Statement

Funding and resource allocation in supply chain systems are often vulnerable to:

- **Errors**: Manual decision-making prone to mistakes
- **Bias**: Subjective judgments affecting fairness
- **Data Manipulation**: Limited visibility and verification
- **Lack of Transparency**: Difficult to justify decisions
- **Accountability Gaps**: No clear audit trails

---

- Speed up analysis compared to manual methods
- Accelerate resource distribution by **35%**

### 4. Explainable Insights
- Provide clear reasoning for each recommendation
- Human-understandable explanations
- Trace every decision path

### 5. Data Visualization & Sharing
- Enable comparison across regions

#### 5. Consumption Expenditure
- **Description**: Household spending on goods and services

## Technical Architecture Policies

### 1. Minimal MeTTa Principles

**Core Instructions**:
- `eval`: One-step evaluation with grounded functions
- `chain`: Variable binding and chaining
- `unify`: Pattern matching

**Design Requirements**:
- Explicit control over evaluation
- No hidden side effects
- Traceable execution paths
- Minimal dependencies

### 2. Code Quality Standards

**All code MUST follow**:
- **Type Annotations**: Clear type hints for all functions
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for classes and public methods
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful messages
- **Testing**: Self-validation on application startup
- **Clean Code**: Separation of concerns, single responsibility

**File Structure**:
```

### 3. MeTTa-Motto Integration

**Connection Requirements**:
- Minimal MeTTa serves as foundation (bite_piper_main.py)
- MeTTa-Motto agents provide advanced features (ses_agents.py)
- Integration bridge function connects both systems
- Fallback to Minimal MeTTa if Hyperon unavailable

**Dependencies**:
- `python-dotenv`: Environment configuration
- `openai`: AI model integration
- `hyperon`: MeTTa-Motto agents (optional)
- `pandas`: Data import (optional)

## Data Governance Policies

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source Verification**: All data must have verified sources
- **Completeness**: All 6 indicators required for priority calculation
- **Accuracy**: Data validation against defined thresholds
- **Timeliness**: Regular updates to maintain relevance

### 2. Data Storage
- **AtomSpace**: In-memory storage for rules and facts
- **Persistence**: Optional database backup (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Security**: No sensitive personal data stored
- **Backup**: Regular exports to JSON format

### 3. Data Usage
