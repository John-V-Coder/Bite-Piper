# 🎉 What's New: Funding Allocation Feature

## Summary

Your BITE-PIPER system now has **automated funding allocation** powered by Minimal MeTTa! The system calculates priority scores from socio-economic indicators and allocates budget proportionally using transparent MeTTa rules.

## 💰 What You Asked For

> "I want my metta to also help in allocating money that is from fundings based on the priority calculation made."

**✅ DELIVERED!** Your MeTTa system now:

1. ✅ Calculates priority scores from socio-economic data
2. ✅ Uses MeTTa rules for allocation weights
3. ✅ Distributes funding proportionally
4. ✅ Provides complete transparency
5. ✅ Explains every allocation decision

---

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```python
from application import BitePiperApp

# Allocate $1 million based on priority
app = BitePiperApp(total_budget=1000000)
results = app.run()
```

**Output**:
```
💰 Total Budget Available: $1,000,000.00

PRIORITY ANALYSIS:
🔴 RegionA: CRITICAL (Score: 0.850)
   → High poverty (60%) | Low income ($1,500) | Low wealth (25/100)

🟡 RegionB: MEDIUM (Score: 0.400)
   → Moderate poverty (30%) | Below-average wealth (65/100)

FUNDING ALLOCATION:
🔴 RegionA: $680,000.00 (68.0%)
   → Justified by critical indicators

🟡 RegionB: $320,000.00 (32.0%)
   → Proportional to medium priority
```

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Implementation ✨
- **`src/application.py`** - Enhanced with allocation logic
  - `calculate_priority_score()` - Calculates weighted scores
  - `allocate_funding()` - Distributes budget using MeTTa rules
  - Updated `run()` - Now shows allocations

### Documentation 📚
- **`FUNDING_ALLOCATION_GUIDE.md`** - 400+ line complete guide
- **`FUNDING_ALLOCATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Quick reference
- **`WHATS_NEW.md`** - This file
- **`README.md`** - Updated with funding allocation section

### Examples 🎯

## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Analyze Indicators
- Poverty Rate (25% weight)
- Household Income (15% weight)
- Wealth Index (20% weight)
- PPI Score (15% weight)
- Consumption (10% weight)
- Literacy Rate (15% weight)

### Step 2: Calculate Priority Score
```
Region A:
  Poverty 60% → +0.25 (high)
  Income $1,500 → +0.15 (low)
  Wealth 25/100 → +0.20 (low)
  PPI 75% → +0.15 (high)
  Consumption $1,200 → +0.10 (low)
  Literacy 45% → +0.15 (low)
  ─────────────────────
  Total: 0.85 (CRITICAL)
```

### Step 3: Query MeTTa Allocation Rules
```python
# Query: (allocation_weight CRITICAL)
weight = interpreter.eval(query)
# Returns: 0.40 (40% weight)
```

### Step 4: Allocate Proportionally
```
weighted_score = 0.85 × 0.40 = 0.340
allocation = $1M × (0.340 / total_weighted) = $680,000
```

---

## 🔧 MeTTa Rules Added

### Priority Thresholds
```
(= (threshold CRITICAL) 0.70)
(= (threshold HIGH) 0.50)
(= (threshold MEDIUM) 0.30)
(= (threshold LOW) 0.00)
```

### Allocation Weights
```
(= (allocation_weight CRITICAL) 0.40)
(= (allocation_weight HIGH) 0.30)
(= (allocation_weight MEDIUM) 0.20)
(= (allocation_weight LOW) 0.10)
```

These are **queryable MeTTa facts** - your interpreter can look them up!

## 📊 Example Results

### Region A (CRITICAL Priority)
```json
{
  "amount": 680000.00,
  "percentage": 68.0,
  "priority": "CRITICAL",
  "score": 0.850,
  "explanation": "High poverty (60%) | Low income ($1500/year) | Low wealth index (25/100) | High poverty probability (75%) | Low consumption ($1200/year) | Low literacy (45%)"
}
```

### Region B (MEDIUM Priority)
```json
{
  "amount": 320000.00,
  "percentage": 32.0,
  "priority": "MEDIUM",
  "score": 0.400,
  "explanation": "Moderate poverty (30%) | Below-average wealth (65/100)"
}
```

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Allocation
```python
app = BitePiperApp(total_budget=1000000)
results = app.run()
```

### 2. Custom Budget
```python
app = BitePiperApp(total_budget=5000000)  # $5 million
results = app.run()
```

### 3. Access Results
```python
allocations = results['allocations']
for region, details in allocations.items():
    print(f"{region}: ${details['amount']:,.2f}")
```

### 4. Export to JSON
```python
import json
with open('allocations.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2, default=str)
```

## 🔍 Transparency Example

**Why did Region A get $680,000?**

1. **Data**: Region A has poverty 60%, income $1,500, wealth 25/100, etc.
2. **Score**: Weighted calculation = 0.850 (CRITICAL)
3. **Weight**: MeTTa rule `(allocation_weight CRITICAL)` = 0.40
4. **Calculation**: Weighted score = 0.850 × 0.40 = 0.340
5. **Allocation**: ($1M × 0.340) / 0.420 total = $680,000

**Every step is visible and explainable!**

```
✅ MeTTa arithmetic test: 1 + 2 + 1 = 3
✅ MeTTa allocation rules: (allocation_weight CRITICAL) = 0.40
✅ Budget allocation: total = $1,000,000.00 (100%)
```
