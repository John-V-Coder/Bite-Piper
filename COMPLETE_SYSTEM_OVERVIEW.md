## 📋 The 6 Indicators (Logical Foundation)

### 1. **Poverty Rate** (25% weight) 🔴
**Measures**: % of population below national poverty line

**Thresholds**:
- **≥60%**: EXTREME - Majority in poverty
- **40-59%**: SEVERE - Nearly half poor
- **20-39%**: MODERATE - Significant poverty
- **<20%**: LOW - Manageable levels

**Logic**: Most direct measure of need. Higher weight because it's the primary poverty indicator.

---

### 2. **Wealth Index** (20% weight) 🏠
**Measures**: Asset ownership score 0-100 (housing, appliances, vehicles)

**Thresholds**:
- **<20**: EXTREME - No basic assets
- **<35**: SEVERE - Minimal possessions
- **<50**: MODERATE - Below average
- **≥50**: LOW/GOOD - Adequate assets

**Logic**: Shows accumulated disadvantage. Second-highest weight because assets indicate long-term structural poverty, not temporary hardship.

**Cross-check with income**: Both low = true poverty, one high = unusual situation

---

### 3. **Household Income Per Capita** (15% weight) 💰
**Measures**: Annual income per household member

**Thresholds** (World Bank standards):
- **<$1,200**: EXTREME - Below $3.3/day (international poverty line)
- **<$2,000**: SEVERE - Below $5.5/day
- **<$3,500**: MODERATE - Below $9.6/day
- **≥$6,000**: ADEQUATE - Comfortable level

**Logic**: Reflects purchasing power. Moderate weight because income alone doesn't show full picture (assets, consumption matter too).

---

### 4. **PPI Score** (15% weight) 📈
**Measures**: Probability (%) of being below poverty threshold

**Thresholds**:
- **≥80%**: EXTREME - Very likely poor
- **60-79%**: SEVERE - High probability
- **40-59%**: MODERATE - Significant risk
- **<40%**: LOW - Lower vulnerability

**Logic**: Predictive measure (future-focused). Equal to income because predicting poverty is as important as measuring current state.

**Cross-check with poverty rate**: Should align; discrepancy = warning

---

### 5. **Consumption Expenditure** (10% weight) 🛒
**Measures**: Annual household spending on goods/services

**Thresholds**:
- **<$1,000**: EXTREME - Subsistence only
- **<$1,800**: SEVERE - Below basic needs
- **<$3,000**: MODERATE - Basic needs barely met
- **≥$3,000**: LOW/ADEQUATE - Modest comfort

**Logic**: Shows actual living standards. Lower weight because consumption can be volatile (seasonal, borrowing).

**Relationship**: Should be 60-80% of income typically

---

### 6. **Literacy Rate** (15% weight) 📚
**Measures**: % of population that can read and write

**Thresholds**:
- **<40%**: EXTREME - Majority illiterate
- **<55%**: SEVERE - Educational crisis
- **<70%**: MODERATE - Below adequate
- **≥70%**: LOW/GOOD - Most literate

**Logic**: Education is pathway out of poverty. Equal to income/PPI because literacy affects long-term economic development.

## 🧮 Advanced Scoring Formula

### Step 1: Normalize Each Indicator
```
Each indicator → Severity level → Score (0.0 to 1.0)

EXTREME  = 1.0  (maximum need)
SEVERE   = 0.8  (high need)
MODERATE = 0.5  (medium need)
LOW      = 0.2  (low need)
MINIMAL  = 0.0  (no need)
```

### Step 2: Apply Weights
```
Weighted Score = Σ (indicator_score × weight)

Example:
Poverty (1.0) × 0.25 = 0.250
Wealth (1.0)  × 0.20 = 0.200
Income (0.8)  × 0.15 = 0.120
PPI (1.0)     × 0.15 = 0.150
Consumption (0.8) × 0.10 = 0.080
Literacy (1.0) × 0.15 = 0.150
                        ─────
Base Score =            0.950
```

### Step 3: Urgency Multiplier
```
Count EXTREME and SEVERE indicators:

4+ EXTREME          → ×1.20 (CRISIS)
3 EXTREME           → ×1.15 (EMERGENCY)
2 EXTREME           → ×1.10 (URGENT)
1 EXTREME + 3 SEVERE → ×1.08 (High urgency)
4+ SEVERE           → ×1.05 (Elevated)
Otherwise           → ×1.00 (Standard)

Example: 4 EXTREME → ×1.20
Final Score = 0.950 × 1.20 = 1.140
```

### Step 4: Priority Level
```
Score ≥ 0.70 → CRITICAL 🔴
Score ≥ 0.50 → HIGH     🟠
Score ≥ 0.30 → MEDIUM   🟡
Score < 0.30 → LOW      🟢
```

---

## 🔍 Cross-Validation Logic

### Check 1: Poverty vs Income
```python
if poverty > 50% and income > $5,000:
    warning: "High poverty but high income - check data"
    
if poverty < 20% and income < $2,000:
    warning: "Low poverty but low income - inconsistent"
```

### Check 2: PPI vs Poverty
```python
if poverty > 50% and ppi < 40%:
    warning: "High poverty but low risk score"
    
if poverty < 20% and ppi > 60%:
    warning: "Low poverty but high risk - concerning trend"
```

### Check 3: Wealth vs Income
```python
if wealth < 30 and income > $5,000:
    warning: "Low assets despite high income - new earners?"
    
if wealth > 70 and income < $2,000:
    warning: "High assets but low income - retirees?"
```

---

## 💰 Allocation Formula

### MeTTa Rules
```
(= (allocation_weight CRITICAL) 0.40)  ; 40% formula weight
(= (allocation_weight HIGH) 0.30)      ; 30% formula weight
(= (allocation_weight MEDIUM) 0.20)    ; 20% formula weight
(= (allocation_weight LOW) 0.10)       ; 10% formula weight
```

### Calculation
```
For each region:
  1. weighted_score = priority_score × allocation_weight
  2. total_weighted = Σ(weighted_score for all regions)
  3. allocation_ratio = weighted_score / total_weighted
  4. allocated_amount = total_budget × allocation_ratio
```

### Example (2 Regions, $1M Budget)

**Region A** - CRITICAL (score: 0.950):
```
weighted_score = 0.950 × 0.40 = 0.380
```

**Region B** - MEDIUM (score: 0.400):
```
weighted_score = 0.400 × 0.20 = 0.080
```

**Allocation**:
```
total_weighted = 0.380 + 0.080 = 0.460

Region A: (0.380 / 0.460) × $1M = $826,087 (82.6%)
Region B: (0.080 / 0.460) × $1M = $173,913 (17.4%)
```

**Result**: CRITICAL region gets 4.8× more funding than MEDIUM region
